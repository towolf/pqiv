.SH NAME
PQIV \- quick image viewer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B $BINARY_NAME [options] <file(s) or folder(s)>
.SH DESCRIPTION
PQIV is a really simple image viewer inspired by qiv.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -i
Suppress the yellow info box in PQIV
.TP
.B -f
Start PQIV in fullscreen mode
.\" unless NO_FADING
.TP
.B -F
Make qiv fade between images. Currently this does only work for images of equal size.
.\" end
.TP
.B -s
Auto start slide show
.TP
.B -S
Follow symlinks. PQIV will not traverse into symlinked directories by default
as this tends to lead to recursion and other problems. If this option
is active, PQIV will follow symlinks. An algorithm to prevent recursion is
implemented. Checking for if a symlink points out of the current node (For
example symlinks to /) is not.
.\" unless NO_SORTING
.TP
.B -n
Sort the file list using natsort
.\" end
.TP
.B -d n
Interval for the slideshow function, in seconds
.TP
.B -t
If used once:  Scale small images up to fill the whole screen
.br
If used twice: Do not shrink image(s) larger than the screen to fit
.TP
.B -r
Read filename(s) from STDIN.
.TP
.B -c
PQIV will draw this well-known chessboard background for transparent images per
default. Use this option to deactivate this behaviour.
.\" unless NO_COMPOSITING
If you use this option twice (and your wm supports it), it will cause the window to be transparent.
Use it three times to make the window stay in the background and use it for times to also disable
controls. You can make PQIV behave like a desktop widget this way.
.\" end
.\" unless NO_INOTIFY
.TP
.B -w
Watch open files for changes and reload them if necessary
.\" end
.TP
.B -z n
Set initial zoom level in percent. This is only useful in conjunction with -t.
.TP
-p n
Select interpolation type for resizing operations. Valid values for n:
.br
.po 5
1: GDK_INTERP_NEAREST, copy the nearest pixel value
.br
2: GDK_INTERP_TILES, tile the image
.br
3: GDK_INTERP_BILINEAR, use bilinear interpolation
.br
4: GDK_INTERP_HYPER, use hyper interpolation
.br
.po 0
.TP
.B -P 
Set window position.
.br
.po 5
left,top: Set initial window position
.br
.po 5
off:      Deactivate positioning
.br
.po 0
Defaults to center of screen.
.TP
.B -a <key><new-key>
Maps <key> to <new-key>. For example, "-a=+" will make "=" an alias for zooming
in.
.TP
.B -R
Reverse the meaning of the cursor and Page Up/Down keys. For example, pressing
the "down" cursor key will normally make the image move down. With this option,
the image will instead move up.
.\" unless NO_KENBURNS
.TP
.B -k
Use kenburns effect in fullscreen slideshows. Note that this feature is
EXPERIMENTAL and terribly slow. Use this option twice to activate scaling
within the effect, which is even slower.
.\" end
.\" unless NO_COMMANDS
.TP
.B -<n>
Use those options (n \in 0..9) to define a command, which will be executed when
you press the corresponding key in PQIV.
.br
.po 5
Prepend the command with
.B >
to show the command's output in a dialog window.
.br
.po 5
Prepend the command with
.B |
to let PQIV pipe the displayed image to your command and read/reload it from
the command's output.
.po 0
.br
.TP
.B -q
Behave (mostly) like the original qiv. With this option qiv will call
.I qiv-command n file
when you press a number key n, where n will be replaced by the key you pressed
and file by the name of the current image.
.\" end
.\" unless NO_CONFIG_FILE
.PP
The contents of
.B ~/.pqivrc
will be prepended to PQIV's argv. So if you want to make an slideshow interval
of 1 second the default for PQIV, put
.nf
	-d1
.fi
into that file.
.PP
.\" end
PQIV will display all files you specified on the command line. Directories will
be searched recursively for files supported by gtk+
(for example: bmp, gif, jpeg, png, wbmp, xpm, svg). Unless you specified
.B -r
the special file
.B -
will cause PQIV to read a file from stdin.
.SH USAGE
In PQIV, you can use both mouse and keyboard to navigate through the images. Execute
.B qiv -h
to get more information on the key bindings.
.PP
If you call PQIV without a TTY on stdin (ie. from GUI) without parameters, PQIV
will pop up an "open file" dialog.
